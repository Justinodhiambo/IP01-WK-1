This repository contains solutions to three coding challenges implemented in Python. The challenges focus on: time conversion, positive number identification, and consonant value calculation.

Challenges

Challenge 1: Converting 12-hour time to 24-hour time

The function convert_to_24_hour takes as input an hour (in the range 1 to 12), a minute (in the range 0 to 59), and a period ("am" or "pm"). It returns a four-digit string encoding the time in 24-hour format.

Challenge 2: Two numbers are positive
The function two_positive takes three integers (a, b, and c) as arguments and returns True if exactly two of the three integers are positive, and False otherwise.

Challenge 3: Consonant value
The function consonant_value takes a lowercase string containing only alphabetic characters and no spaces. It returns the highest value of consonant substrings, where consonants are any letters of the alphabet except "aeiou."
